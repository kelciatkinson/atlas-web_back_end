# python_async_comprehension

This directory demonstrates the implementation of asynchronous comprehensions and generators in Python. It focuses on working with working with async operations and handling coroutines effectively.

## Description

This project contains usages of asynchronous patterns that involve Python's async features, specifically focusing on:
- Async generators
- Async comprehensions
- Coroutines
- Type annotations

## Files

### 0-async_generator.py
A coroutine that yields random numbers asynchronously.

### 1-async_comprehension.py
Implements an async comprehension to collect random numbers from the async generator.

### 2-measure_runtime.py
A coroutine that executes async comprehensions in parallel using asyncio.gather.
